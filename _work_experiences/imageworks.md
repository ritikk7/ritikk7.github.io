When you work at a studio that brings *Academy Award-winning movies* to life, the bar isn't just high — it's stratospheric. As a Software Engineer at **Sony Pictures Imageworks**, I spent eight months building tools that 1,000+ artists and technical directors used daily to create the films we know and love.

One of my main missions? Making **Confluence** actually usable inside the studio’s ecosystem. I engineered a full-stack integration directly into our internal documentation tool, spNote, allowing artists to post and fetch documentation — screenshots, GIFs, rollover images, you name it — without leaving their creative zone. I worked with **Angular**, **Electron**, and **Flask**, and used a bunch of technicals tricks like **async I/O**, **caching**, **pagination**, or **access control** wizardry to make sure the experience was fast, reliable, and nearly unbreakable, even under heavy production loads.

The next big challenge: connecting **Maya**, **Houdini**, and **Katana** directly to spNote. I designed and built a **multi-threaded architecture** with **Python** and **Electron** that used **Web Sockets** to let Digital Content Creation tools and spNote talk to each other in real-time. Artists could now swap scripts, screenshots, and videos between tools with a click — making documentation, feedback, and collaboration so seamless it felt like magic.

Meanwhile, the studio was migrating decades worth of knowledge from **Twiki** to **Confluence**. I facilitated the migration with a custom **Python** tool that scraped, rebuilt, and preserved over **1 million documents** — maintaining internal links, hierarchies, and structure during the chaos.

One of my favorite moments was building a **command-line pipeline** to automatically move Houdini Help Cards into Confluence, transforming a clunky manual process into something FX teams loved so much it got recognized by the company president (or so I was told haha).

But honestly? The work was only half the experience.

Sony Imageworks has a vibe that’s hard to describe until you live it. Weekly events like **specialty coffee days** (with an in-house barista making unlimited custom drinks on Tuesdays and Wednesdays) and **Beer O'Clock Thursdays** kept the energy flowing. We had **regular film screenings** in their private theaters — the legendary "**Sweat Boxes**" — a tradition straight out of Disney's early animation days where directors would screen and critique rough cuts.

Cultural celebrations weren’t just banners and emails — they went all out for **Diwali**, **Día de los Muertos**, **Hanukkah**, and every festival in between. The office itself felt like walking through film history: **original props**, **massive murals**, and **posters** from iconic movies (especially *Spider-Man*) covered every wall.

The biggest personal milestone for me? **Getting credited on a real film** — and getting my own [**IMDb**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm16905991/) page. For a film geek like me, that was a dream come true. Even better, I got to work shoulder-to-shoulder with the insanely talented artists who make the worlds we escape into on screen.

Working at Sony wasn’t just a job. It was a chance to build tools that fueled creativity at the highest level — and to feel, every day, like you were part of something much bigger than yourself.
